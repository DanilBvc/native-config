If AAA is not available to conduct arbitration, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR provider. The rules of the ADR provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, except to the extent such rules are inconsistent with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at adr.org or by calling AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (USD 10,000.00) may be resolved through binding arbitration without a hearing, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (USD 10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator must provide the parties with reasonable notice of the date, time, and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Organization made to you prior to the commencement of arbitration, the Organization will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and expenses of the ADR provider."
